# T-SQL
This repo is to document my learning and practices with T-SQL. Some of the files are excercises done on AdventureWorks while others are queries done on a database I created named after mysel, Micy. 'Micy' is a database used for purchasing function therefore it has tables as supplier tables, purchase order tables, goods receipt tables.

Below is a list of areas of knowledge of T-SQL that I have in here. More to be added. 
  1. create tables;
  2. create triggers; 
  3. create transactions; 
  4. run queries using join, subqueries, or common table expression;
